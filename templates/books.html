              This book is much more than just a "programming" book, it's a book about how to become a good professional
              in any jobs area. Many tips I've applied in my professional/personal life, such as managing time,
              negotiating "tech debts", always documenting your code, testing your code, fixing "break windows", etc.
              This is an AMAZING book for anyone, I recommend it for everyone.

            <p>This is the best book I've ever read on algorithms. Before reading this book, I had no
              many ideas about DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) and this book has helped me a lot, but I still have
              a
              lot to learn. It's definitely a must-read.
